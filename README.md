Hello lovelies,
I am here for the first time. 
I am currently learning the HTML CSS & the basics of JV Script.
So I am new here I would be highly obliged to meet new programmers and learners who would help me and also the other beginners to have a good hold on the fundamentals and how the process goes.
To all existing programmers and learners I hope you will not mind in helping me getting started and also help me develop massive things later on in here.
I would love to collaborate with the other programmers and for those who wish for collaborating could drop an email at  power.is.here03@gmail.com
Thank you so much for being here!
LEARNING AND GROWING!
